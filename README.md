# Practical Machine Learning Course Project

This repo includes the results of [Coursera's Practical Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/predmachlearn) class project offered by the Johns Hopkins University.

It contains the following files:

* `analysis.Rmd`: The first part describes the conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA). The EDA even 
includes the submission part because surprising facts about the testing set were
revealed right at the beginning. In the second part we build and train a random forest model to calculate the estimate of the testing set error based on cross-validation
* `qualitative_activity_recognition_of_wle.pdf`: Study whose results we try to reproduce in parts
